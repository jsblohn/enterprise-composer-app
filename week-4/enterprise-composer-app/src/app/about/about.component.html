      <p>Johann Strauss II was born in Vienna, Australia on October 25, 1825. His father, Johann Strauss I, was also a composer. Johann II wrote over 500 musical compositions; 150 of them were waltzes. His most famous waltz is probably <i>The Blue Danube</i>, which was written in 1867, and helped to establish him as “the Waltz King”.</p>

      <p>In 1844, he began conducting music while he was still a teenager. He began composing music soon after. He quit conducting for the most part around 1862 in order to focus on writing music.</p>

      <p>He died on June 3, 1899 from a respiratory illness that turned into pneumonia. <a href="https://www.biography.com/musician/johann-strauss"><i style="font-size: .6rem;">Source</i></a></p>
